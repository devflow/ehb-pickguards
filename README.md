D-Style pickguard.

I'm very new to CAD and had a lot of trouble drawing this, and the measurements were also very challenging for me, but when I actually printed out a prototype using the drawings, it fit very well. I cut the acrylic with a laser and filleted it myself with hand tools. This is good enough for 4$.

I would recommend keeping the thickness to 3mm or less, because the pickup height from the factory is quite a bit lower than you might think. It can be difficult to put your thumb on the pickup. 

The attachment is done with double-sided tape. It takes courage to drill into the body to use permanent screws.

I'd love it if you made different styles and shared them.

>  But strangely, depending on the year of production, it seems to fit slightly less perfectly - test it on a prototype first!!!or maybe it's just a QC failure.
